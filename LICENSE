Preamble

The Blind License is a free to use license that ensures whatever works
the license has been applied to have no concept of the world beyond its
own scope.

Licenses for open source works have taken away freedom from users and
their ability to license their own works under a licensing scheme that
they choose. These licenses have been designed to strip this freedom
away with intentions of placing emphasis on the provider. The Blind
License is designed to grant both the user and the provider the
freedom they need to freely and commercially distribute works, as well
for providing protections for both parties. Everyone is free to use and
distribute this license but to ensure equal protections on both parties
this license is not permitted to be modified in any way, shape, form,
branding, title, etc.

Terms & Conditions

0. Definitions

"This license" and "the license" refers to the Blind License.

"The program" and "works" refers to any  works licensed
under the Blind License.

"User" and "users" refer to entitie(s) using the works licensed under
the Blind License.

"Provider" refers to the entity that published works licensed under the
Blind License.

1. Permissions

Only the provider is permitted to change the licensing of their published
works and users must abide by this principle. Users are free to modify,
use, and distribute the works of the provider however users are not permitted
to sell the works, or parts of it, without written consent from the provider.
These freedoms do come with stipulations, which will be covered below.

1.1 Modifying

Users are free to modify the works of a provider, and it is encouraged that they
do so. However, modifying the works does not nullify the license nor does it
make the works the property of the user. The works must continue to be branded,
marketed, distributed, and licensed the same as before modifying the works. Users
are not free to change or modify the license of the works either. If the modification
is an improvement or fix on the works, then those changes must be brought to the
attention of the provider and the provider will have permission to apply those
changes to the original works for everyone to benefit from. For example, we have two
products, A and B. Product A is a media processing library licensed under the Blind
License and Product B is a media player that implements Product A. Product A has a
flaw in which the providers of Product B have fixed. The providers of Product B
must notify the provider of Product A of such improvements or fixes as well for
giving the provider of Product A the modified source code so that the provider of
Product A can implement those changes into their original works so that all users
of Product A can continue to receive quality services. Providers of Product B are
not free to modify the name or branding of Product A, even after modifications,
nor do modifications of Product A give exclusive ownership of Product A or the ability
publish Product A as their own unique works.

1.2 Selling & Distributing

Users are not free to sell the works, or parts of the works, of a provider but
are free to sell the works in which the works of a provider has been implemented
into. For example, we have two products, A and B. Product A is a component
licensed under this license and Product B is a product that heavily relies on
Product A. Providers of Product B are free to sell Product B and distribute copies
of Product A with it, however, Product A or parts of Product A cannot be sold on
its own without written consent from the provider of Product A. When selling or
publishing works of any kind that implements the works of a provider, it is required
that this license also be distributed with the works of the provider. Users however
are free to license their own works under any licensing scheme that they choose but
this license must not affect the licensing of the provider. For example, Product B
being licensed under the MIT license does not change the licensing of Product A and
the license of Product A must continue to be upheld. Users that sell or distribute
the works of the provider ARE NOT required to give credit to the provider and the
provider IS NOT permitted to make requests for credit either. However, users must
be honest when asked where they got the works of a provider. Giving credit can be
defined as hyperlinks, wording (audible, digital, written, etc.), or branding which
points to a product or provider. Works which make use of this license have no concept
of credit or anything beyond the scope of itself and this license. However, it is highly
recommended for those using this license to provide a hyperlink in the applicable section
above on where the works can be obtained. Doing such allows users to know where they
can find the works in case they need a specific version of the works for compatibility
reasons.

1.3 Usage

Users are free to use the works of a provider, however they are not free to use parts of
the works of the provider without written consent. For example, you cannot copy parts of
the works of a provider into your own works and instead must use the works of the provider
in its entirety, while also abiding by the license set forth by the provider. If the works
of a provider is meant to be compiled as an executable or library, then the works of the
provider must continue to be used as such. If the works of the provider is neither of the
former however and instead is source code for those to implement into their own works then
such usage is permitted. Users of such source code, as described above, are still required
to distribute the license of the provider with the works that implement the works of the
provider and even in this situation users are not free to take ownership of the works of
the provider.

2. Patents

You may not patent the works of a provider published under this license.

3. License Modifications

Only the providers are permitted to modify the license and such modifications are purely
limited to the fields above that indicate the title of the works, the author and copyright
information of the works, and a link on where the works can be obtained.

4. Revisions

Only BlindEye Softworks retains the right to modify this license and may only do such to
keep up to date with current trends or issues. When updating this license, either the version
number or revision number will change. For revision changes of a specific version, ALL
works using the version of the license in which the revision took place will be affected
automatically. However, those using the license are not required to ship an updated license.
Instead, users may look up the most recent revision of the specific version of the license
using the link above. Swapping the license which has shipped or that you are shipping yourself
with one of the same version and newer revision is permitted, but must be the latest
revision for that version.

5. Violation

Violating this license and/or the terms set forth will automatically relinquish the ability of
using, selling, modifying, etc., the works published under this license and in such situations
you will be required to destroy all copies unless stated otherwise by the provider in written
form. The provider is also permitted to take legal action for financial damages and/or
deformation.
