# BlindEye.XInput
### *Bring new life, and controls, to any of your games and tooling.*

BlindEye.Xinput is a managed and feature-rich wrapper over the unmanaged [XInput API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xinput/xinput-game-controller-apis-portal). Providing interoperability and maximum API coverage, this wrapper enables developers to implement the functionality of a wide array of XInput devices in their existing projects. Many parts of the XInput API are undocumented and exclusively reserved by Microsoft, being used internally within Xbox console operating systems starting with the Xbox 360, as well for Xbox-related utilities shipped for Windows. This wrapper provides full-coverage over those undocumented functions and data structures, which at the core power most of the functionality exposed by this wrapper.

### Features:
- XInput 1.4 Prioritized
- Fully Unlocked - All undocumented functions have been reverse engineered and implemented to provide you with the same functionality as the pros.
- Simplistic Codebase - It is important that this wrapper mimics the XInput API as close as possible for those already accustomed with the API and to also be welcoming for beginners just getting started. Due to this, developers may use the original documentation of the XInput API as a reference.
- Full Control - In this wrapper you will only find the essential functions needed for you to hit the ground running as quick as possible. This decision promotes full customizability at the tip of your fingers.
